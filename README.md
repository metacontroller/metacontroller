## Metacontroller

Metacontroller is an add-on for Kubernetes
that makes it easy to write and deploy [custom controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers)
in the form of [simple scripts](https://metacontroller.app).

This is not an officially supported Google product.
Although this open-source project was started by [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/),
the add-on works the same in any Kubernetes cluster.
