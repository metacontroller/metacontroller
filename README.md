# Metacontroller

Metacontroller is an add-on for Kubernetes that makes it easy to write and
deploy [custom controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/#custom-controllers)
in the form of [simple scripts](https://metacontroller.app).

## A New Home
This is the new community owned and actively maintained home for Metacontroller. The open-source [project](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller) started by [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) is no longer maintained. All future updates and releases for Metacontroller will come from this repository. In time, all [issues](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/issues) from the previous repository will be triaged and moved [here](https://github.com/metacontroller/metacontroller/issues). We are excited to move forward with Metacontroller as a community maintained project. A big thank you to all of the wonderful Metacontroller community members that made this happen!

Following is the immediate plan of actions:
- [x] Make this repo same as https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller
- [ ] Make a release that uploads the image [here](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/metacontrollerio)
- [ ] Fix Docker image vulnerability [issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller/issues/202)
- [ ] Merge changes from [Metac](https://github.com/AmitKumarDas/metac) to this repo
