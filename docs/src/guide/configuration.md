## Command line flags

The Metacontroller server has a few settings that can be configured
with command-line flags (by editing the Metacontroller StatefulSet
in `manifests/metacontroller.yaml`):

| Flag | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--zap-log-level` | Zap log level to configure the verbosity of logging. Can be one of ‘debug’, ‘info’, ‘error’, or any integer value > 0 which corresponds to custom debug levels of increasing verbosity(e.g. `--zap-log-level=5`). Level 4 logs Metacontroller's interaction with the API server. Levels 5 and up additionally log details of Metacontroller's invocation of lambda hooks. See the [troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md) for more.                                                    |

| `--leader-election` | Determines whether or not to use leader election when starting metacontroller (default `false`, e.g., `--leader-election`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--leader-election-resource-lock` | Determines which resource lock to use for leader election (default `leases`, e.g., `--leader-election-resource-lock=leases`). Valid resource locks are `endpoints`, `configmaps`, `leases`, `endpointsleases`, or `configmapsleases`. See the client-go documentation [leaderelection/resourcelock](https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/client-go/tools/leaderelection/resourcelock#pkg-constants) for additional information.                                                                         |
| `--leader-election-namespace` | Determines the namespace in which the leader election resource will be created. If metacontroller is running in-cluster, the default leader election namespace is the same namespace as metacontroller. If metacontroller is running out-of-cluster, the default leader election namespace is undefined. If you are running metacontroller out-of-cluster with leader election enabled, you must specify the leader election namespace. (e.g., `--leader-election-namespace=metacontroller`) |
| `--leader-election-id` | Determines the name of the resource that leader election will use for holding the leader lock. For example, if the leader election id is `metacontroller` and the leader election resource lock is `leases`, then a resource of kind `leases` with metadata.name `metacontroller` will hold the leader lock. (default metacontroller, e.g., `--leader-election-id=metacontroller`)                                                                                                           |
| `--health-probe-bind-address` | The address the health probes endpoint binds to (default ":8081", e.g., `--health-probe-bind-address=":8081"`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `--target-label-selector` | [Label selector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors) used to restrict an instance of metacontroller to manage specific Composite and Decorator controllers, which enables the ability to run multiple metacontroller instances on the same cluster (e.g. `--target-label-selector=controller-group=cicd"`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Logging flags are being set by `controller-runtime`, more on the meaning of them can be found [here](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/references/logging/#overview)

## Running multiple instances

Metacontroller can be setup to run multiple instances in the same Kubernetes cluster that can watch resources based on separate grouping or as a way to split responsibilities; which can also act as a scaling aid.

This is made possible by configuring Metacontroller with the `target-label-selector` argument.

Further details on this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/metacontroller/metacontroller/issues/218).

### Pros

* Clean separation of different Metacontroller instances, in case of
  * Permissions needed to manage its controllers (they can be limited to what the actual operator needs)
  * Allowing the Sidecar pattern - so in the pod there is Metacontroller pod and operator pod, metacontroller manages only this operator.
* Allow scaling (in a primitive way in term of separation of concerns / grouping)

### Cons

* Metacontroller fighting over resources - can be caused by two Metacontroller instances managing the same CRD
  * Care needs to be taken when configuring multiple Metacontroller instances and not just deploy the default configuration but properly set the `target-label-selector` value for each Metacontroller instance to be unique if what it is managing.

### Example

#### 1. Configure Metacontroller

Add the `--target-label-selector` argument to Metacontroller binary arguments; below this is inside the Kubernetes deployment spec for Metacontroller:

```yaml
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --zap-devel
        - --zap-log-level=5
        - --discovery-interval=5s
        - --target-label-selector=controller-group=cicd
...
```

You can also use the more advanced features like [Equality-based requirement](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#equality-based-requirement) and [Set-base requirement](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-based-requirement) when defining your target label selector.



#### 2. Specify labels on the Controller

Below is an example of a [Decorator Controller](https://metacontroller.github.io/metacontroller/api/decoratorcontroller.html) that has the appropriate label added so that this instance of Metacontroller can target and manage it:

```yaml
apiVersion: metacontroller.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: DecoratorController
metadata:
  name: pod-name-label
  labels:
    controller-group: cicd
spec:
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    resource: pods
    annotationSelector:
      matchExpressions:
      - {key: pod-name-label, operator: Exists}
  hooks:
    sync:
      webhook:
        url: http://service-per-pod.metacontroller/sync-pod-name-label
```
